## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vihao1802/g-scores-project.git
```

```bash
cd g-scores-project
```

### 2. Project Local Setup

- ⚠️ Use two terminal to run this project

#### Backend

1. From the `root` directory, move to `backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

3. Change the following values in the `.env` file to match your database configuration:

   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
   DB_HOST=localhost
   DB_PORT=5432
   DB_DATABASE=score_db # or any name you want
   DB_USERNAME=<database_username>
   DB_PASSWORD=<database_password>
   ```

4. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

5. Run these to set up the database and seed it with initial data:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

- This seeding data process will take a while to finish

  ```bash
  php artisan db:seed
  ```

- Code for seeding data from csv file to database is in [ScoreSeeder.php](backend/database/seeders/ScoreSeeder.php)

6. Run the following command to start the server:
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

#### Frontend

1. From the `root` directory, move to `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Create a copy of the `.env.example` file and name it `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the following command to start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Access the Application

- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:8000
- PostgreSQL: localhost:5432

### Docker Setup (optional)

1. From the `root` directory, start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```

2. Run database migrations and seed it with initial data:

   ```bash
   docker-compose exec backend php artisan migrate
   ```

- This seeding data process will take a while to finish

  ```bash
  docker-compose exec backend php artisan db:seed
  ```

3. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:8000
   - PostgreSQL: localhost:5432
